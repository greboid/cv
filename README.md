After a long time of using [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and not really understanding it well enough to make the
modifications I wanted and odd side effects happening when I did make changes I wrote this CV from scratch in latex.

This should be fairly easy to use for your own CV by filling in the details and should be simple enough to make any
required changes you need.

I've included a Dockerfile with a latex environment and a makefile that will create and run this for you.
